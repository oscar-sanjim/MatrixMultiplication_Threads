 * File name: FileIO.c
 *
 * Author:  Abelardo Lopez Lagunas
 *
 * Purpose: Support routines that handle reading ASCII files
 *
 * References:
 *          Based on my own code, but won't be surprised if it is
 *          similar to other code out there
 *
 * Restrictions:
 *          All functions return (-1) in case something went wrong
 *
 * Revision history:
 *          Feb  4 15:15 2011 - File created
 *
 *          May 22 09:13 2012 - Added recognition of negative numbers.
 *
 *          Jan 30 15:44 2014 - Added recognition of strings. Note that
 *                              the Analyzer indicates potential memory
 *                              leaks in GetString because a malloc is done
 *                              inside the code and a pointer to it returned
 *
 *          Jan 31 17:02 2014 - Fixed potential memory leak by redefining
 *                              how GetString works.
 *
 * Error handling:
 *          None
 *
 * Notes:
 *          Support routine that reads an ASCII file and returns an
 *          integer value skiping over non-numeric data.

 *  Function: GetInt
 *
 *  Purpose:  The function will read the input file and return an integer
 *            representing the ASCII characters that form a number. It
 *            skips over comments, which begin a line with a #, and other
 *            ASCII characters that do not represent numbers.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *            input    Pointer to the text file to parse
 *
 *            output   Integer representing value. If the end of file is
 *                     reached a -1 is returned.

 *  Function: GetString
 *
 *  Purpose:  The function will read the input file and return a string.
 *            It skips over comments, which begin a line with a #, and other
 *            ASCII characters that do not represent alphabetic characters.
 *            The maximum length of the string is 256 characters. Memory is
 *            allocated by this function and should be freed by the caller.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *            input    Pointer to the text file to parse
 *
 *            output   String found in the file. If the end of file is
 *                     reached a NULL is returned.
